  <quotText>Above all, must be noticed a beautiful little humble ixia, which the Dutch call the <catchword>
      <i>avond-bloom</i>
    </catchword> (the evening flower); it is the modest <i>Ixia cinnamomea</i>, which, having concealed itself during the day within its brown calyx, now expands its small white blossoms, and perfumes the air, throughout the night, with its fragrant odour.</quotText>
